Citizens are as free as possible, there are no social security funds or state redistribution, and the state's influence on private life is kept to a minimum. At the top is an autocrat who rules without democratic participation in order to protect society from harmful interference, abuse of power by parties, and a creeping development towards socialism or communism. The goal is a stable order in which individual freedom and property are permanently guaranteed.
