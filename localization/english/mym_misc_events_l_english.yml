  stoker.2.t: "A schooner, driven ashore"
  stoker.2.d: "An unexpected end."
  stoker.2.f: "August 4, still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce; I know there is something aboard, and still I dare not speak. The men are beyond fear, working stolidly and patiently, with minds made up to the worst. We are past the Straits of Dover, and I feel ever more dread as we draw near to England. God grant that we may never see land! I am at the end of my tether. I can hardly write; I can hardly think, but I know that unless I act soon, I may be too late. The crew of the Demeter are dead or gone, I alone am left to manage the ship.\n\nGod help us!\n\n#italic  - Captain's Log, last record of the Dmitry#!"
  stoker.2.a: "Rabies, obviously. Case closed."
