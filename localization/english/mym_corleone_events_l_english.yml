  corleone.1.d: "#italic Little Italy, New York City - In a shocking turn of events, the feared and influential leader of the Black Hand extortion racket, Don Fanucci, was found dead late last night on August 15th, 1920. The incident occurred in the heart of Little Italy, on the corner of Mott and Hester Streets, sending waves of both relief and anxiety through the local immigrant community."
  corleone.1.f: "Eyewitnesses reported hearing several gunshots shortly after sundown, though the streets were unusually quiet at the time. Fanucci's body was discovered slumped in a doorway, with multiple gunshot wounds to the chest and head. Authorities believe the assassin must have been a skilled marksman due to the precision of the shots.\n\nDon Fanucci, known for his ruthless extortion of local business owners under the guise of \"protection\" fees, had long dominated Little Italy through fear and intimidation. His death marks the end of a reign of terror that many thought would never be challenged.\n\nPolice have yet to identify any suspects, but given Fanucci's extensive list of enemies, officials expect this case to prove difficult to solve. The local Sicilian-American community, which has been plagued by Fanucci's criminal dealings, remains tight-lipped.\n\nWhile the death of Fanucci is welcomed by many victims of his extortion, authorities are concerned this could spark a violent power struggle for control over his rackets in the neighborhood.\n\nThe murder of Don Fanucci adds to the growing unrest in New York's underworld, where tensions between rival gangs and criminal organizations are said to be nearing a boiling point."
