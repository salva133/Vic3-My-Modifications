# Burgundian System
 gov_mym_burgundian_system: "Burgundian System"
 gov_mym_burgundian_system_desc: "It calls for extreme Spartanism, a lifestyle with as little consumption and as few luxuries as possible. It seeks to cleanse the world of all Unterrassen, thus ensuring that the pure population can re-populate the world. The Burgundian System views that the world has been so corrupted due to the communists and degeneracy that it will attempt to scorch the earth. Under this system, the disabled, the obese, LGBT, and others will be either executed or used as slaves. The rest of its people will have a mandatory 18 hours of 'paid labor'. Not every variation of Burgundian System seeks to destroy the world. However, prolonged presence of the Burgundian System causes massive instability due to its unsustainable nature, leading to its collapse... maybe.\n\n$TRANSFER_OF_POWER_NAME_DESC$\n\nTHERE IS NO HOPE UNDER THE BLACK SUN!"
